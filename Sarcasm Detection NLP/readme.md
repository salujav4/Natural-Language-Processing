# Sarcasm Detection using LSTM
The above model classifies a sentence into a Sarcastic or a Non-Sarcastic comment.
The words are embedded using One-Hot Encoder. 
A Long-Short Term Memory RNN classifier is used for modelling with the validation accuracy of ~80%.
The notebook ends with an example sentence which is being predicted as Sarcastic/Non-Sarcastic.
Thank You
